- CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system.
- You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that element's children (which become Grid Items).
