<h2 id = "history">History</h2>
<p>The site of the Kuala Lumpur City Centre was historically part of an affluent suburban residential area north of the old Kuala Lumpur town, linked to the town via Ampang Road and populated by bungalows and mansions dating as far back as the colonial early-20th century. The centrepiece of the area was the original site of the Selangor Turf Club,[1] with many houses constructed around the site to capitalise on views of the racing course. As large scale development moved northwards from old Kuala Lumpur town after the 1950s, development of the area gradually shifted from low-density residential homes to high-density commercial complexes and offices, raising the appeal of developing the suburb into a new commercial centre for Kuala Lumpur. In 1988, the Selangor Turf Club site and adjoining residential parcels were sold to be cleared away for the KLCC project; the Turf Club was subsequently relocated to Serdang. In the subsequent years after the relocation of the Turf Club, more surrounding residential plots were acquired for further development of the KLCC.</p>







<h2 id ="twin">Petronas Twin Tower</h2>
<p>Constructed between 1993 and 1998, the Petronas Twin Towers were the tallest buildings in the world from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2004. Currently, it still holds the record for the tallest twin buildings in the world. It is the headquarters of Petronas, a Fortune 100 state-owned oil company and also the largest company in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The towers and the mall below were designed by Argentinian born architect César Pelli. Construction started in 1991 and was completed 7 years later, in the midst of Asian Financial Crisis and Reformasi movement. Due to the soil conditions of the site, the buildings were built on one of the deepest foundations in the world. The Building Services engineer contractor was Flack + Kurtz which is currently part of the WSP | Parsons Brinkerhoff Company.</p>
